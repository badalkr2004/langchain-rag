Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python emphasizes code readability, using simple syntax that allows programmers to express ideas in fewer lines of code compared to other languages like Java or C++.

⚙️ Key Features of Python

Easy to Learn and Read – Python’s syntax is close to natural English, making it beginner-friendly.

Interpreted Language – You don’t need to compile Python code; it runs line by line.

Dynamically Typed – You don’t have to declare variable types explicitly.

Extensive Libraries – Python has powerful standard libraries (like math, os, datetime) and third-party ones (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, etc.).

Portable and Cross-Platform – The same code can run on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

Object-Oriented and Functional – Supports both programming styles.

Open Source – Free to use and distribute.

💡 What Can You Do with Python?

Python is extremely versatile. It’s used in:

Web Development → Django, Flask

Data Science & Machine Learning → Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

Automation / Scripting → Automating repetitive tasks

Game Development → Pygame

Cybersecurity → Ethical hacking tools and analysis

Artificial Intelligence → Chatbots, NLP, Computer Vision

Internet of Things (IoT) → Controlling hardware devices

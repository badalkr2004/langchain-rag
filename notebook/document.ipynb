It was first introduced in\\nthe field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has become a key idea behind\\nmany modern AI models such as Transformers, BERT, and GPT.\\nIn traditional neural networks, all input data is treated equally, which can make it\\ndifficult for models to capture long-term dependencies. Attention solves this by\\nassigning different ‚Äúweights‚Äù to different parts of the input, meaning the model can\\ndecide which words, pixels, or features are most important for the current task.\\nThe mechanism works by computing a score for each input element based on its\\nrelevance to the output being generated. These scores are then converted into\\nprobabilities using a softmax function. The model uses these probabilities to focus\\nmore on important elements while ignoring less relevant ones.\\nThere are different types of attention mechanisms, including: ‚Ä¢ Additive Attention ‚Äì\\ncompares the query and key using a feed-forward network. ‚Ä¢ Dot-Product\\n(Multiplicative) Attention ‚Äì uses a dot product to measure similarity. ‚Ä¢ Self-Attention\\n‚Äì allows a sequence to look at itself to capture relationships between its elements.\\nThis is the foundation of the Transformer model.\\nIn summary, Attention helps models understand context better by dynamically\\nfocusing on relevant information.
